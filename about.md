I bore in the 70's start my journey as a programmer in 2000  
First I used Visual Basic move to C# done a lot of I.T, Databases and Web sites.  
&nbsp;  
In the last 10 years, I moved to Linux and Embedded world.  
Start programming in **Python** and **C++**, Done some Networking projects and Reversing stuff.
&nbsp;  
Recently I start a new journey in **Robotics** using **Open source** projects like:
- ROS
- Ardupilot and PX4
- Arduino, Raspberry PI, and other embedded boards.
- OpenCV
&nbsp;  
My new blog focus on these fields especially ROS, Gazebo, Pixhawk and of course **Coding**.
Most of the time I used Python but Gazebo and ROS force me to C++ glances.
&nbsp;  
In my spare time, I loved to swim especially in the sea ride my x-trailer bike and be with my family cooking good meals and enjoy my close's circle.
