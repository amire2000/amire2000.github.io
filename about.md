I was borne in the 70's and I began my journey as a programmer in 2000.  
First I used Visual Basic move to C# done a lot of I.T, Databases and Web sites.  
&nbsp;  
In the last 10 years, I moved to Linux and Embedded world.  
Started programming in **Python** and **C++**, Done some Networking projects and Reversing stuff.  
&nbsp;  
Recently I start a new journey in **Robotics** using **Open source** projects like:
- ROS
- Ardupilot and PX4
- Arduino, Raspberry PI, and other embedded boards.
- OpenCV  

&nbsp;  
My new blog focuses on these fields especially ROS, Gazebo,   
Pixhawk and of course **Coding**.  
I always love to learn new things and do some hands-on.  
Most of the time I used Python but Gazebo and ROS forces me to C++ glances.  

&nbsp;  
In my spare time, I love to swim especially in the sea ride my x-trailer bike and be with my family cooking good meals and enjoy my close's circle.
