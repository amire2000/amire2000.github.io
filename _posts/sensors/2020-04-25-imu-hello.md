# Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
DOF refer to the movement of rigid body inside space  
There are only 6 DOF that can divide into two groups
- Translation
- Rotation

## Translation
- Forward / Back
- Up / Down
- Left / Right

## Rotation
- Roll
- Pitch
- Yaw

# IMU
An Inertial Measurement Unit ×Ÿs an electronic device that measures and reports velocity, orientation, and gravitational forces, using a combination of sensors 
- accelerometers
- gyroscopes
- magnetometers

## accelerometers
Accelerometers are devices that measure acceleration forces (speed changes over time)
