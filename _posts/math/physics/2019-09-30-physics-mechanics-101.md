Object continue to do what they're doing unless some external unbalanced force acts on them


## distance and displacment

## Mass
How much matter is in a body or object
basic unit (SI) Kg


## Weight
Force of gravity on mass

```
F = ma

F: Force (newtons)
m: mass (kg)
a: Acceleration (m/s^2)


W = mg

W: wegiht (N)
m: mass (kg)
g: gravity (9.8 kg/s^2)


```
