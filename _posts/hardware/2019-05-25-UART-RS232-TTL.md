# Serial

The devices must share three wires
for:
    - Ground as a common reference 
    - Sending data (TX)
    - Receiving data (RX)
- And some settings
    - rate: Baud rate in bps (bits per second) for example: 9600, 115200
    - voltage level, what is logic high (3.3v or 5v) and logic low (0v)


# UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
UART is not a communication protocol like SPI and I2C, but a physical circuit in a microcontroller, or a stand-alone IC. A UART’s main purpose is to transmit and receive serial data.

UART is responsible for sending and receiving a sequence of bits. At the output of a UART these bits are usually represented by logic level voltages. These bits can become RS-232, RS-422, RS-485

UART transmitted data is organized into packets. Each packet contains 1 start bit, 5 to 9 data bits (depending on the UART), an optional parity bit, and 1 or 2 stop bits:

Examples:
    - 9600 8N1: 9600 baud rate, 8bits of data , No parity, 1 stop bit

# TTL (transistor-transistor logic)
When using TTL in Serial communication we referrer to voltage level, usually working voltage 3.3vdc or 5vdc, when a logic high is represent by vcc and logic low is 0V

# RS-232
Serial protocol when a logic high ('1') is represented by a negative voltage – anywhere from -3 to -25V.
while a logic low ('0') transmits a positive voltage that can be anywhere from +3 to +25V
