- Install scapy
- Scapy basic
- Run scapy as non root user


# Run scapy as non root user
Set python binary permission by set capabilities
> Capabilities: Linux capabilities provide a subset of the available root privileges to a process like  `raw network`

For using scapy we need set caps to python binary and tcpdump, in virtualenv we set the local python binary

- Before capability set
```python
>>> from scapy.all import  *
>>> p=IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/ICMP()
>>> r=sr1(p)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ....
    _socket.socket.__init__(self, family, type, proto, fileno)
PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
```

```bash
#Craft and  forge
sudo setcap cap_net_raw=eip /usr/bin/pythonX.X
#For sniffing
sudo setcap cap_net_raw=eip /usr/bin/tcpdump
```

## Set capability
```bash
# python 3 virtual environment
sudo setcap cap_net_raw=eip venv/bin/python3
# view file capability
getcap venv/bin/python3
venv/bin/python3 = cap_net_raw+eip
```

## Run again
```
>>> from scapy.all import *
>>> p=IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/ICMP()
>>> r=sr1(p)
Begin emission:
.Finished sending 1 packets.
*
Received 2 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets
```

>  Tips:
> - setcap: 
> - getcap:  view binary file capabilities
> - Remove cap example: `sudo setcap -r venv/bin/python3`
