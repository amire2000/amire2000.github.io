# Netplan
- set wlan static ip (wlan0 as AP) 
> Fail to setup static ip to wlan0


```yaml
TBD
```

- Demo connect to wifi ap
  - with static ip
  
```yaml
network:
    version: 2
    wifis:
           wlan0:
                   dhcp4: false
                   addresses: [192.168.2.87/24]
                   gateway4: 192.168.2.1
                   nameservers:
                           addresses: [8.8.8.8]
                   access-points:
                        "my ssid":
                        password: "my password"
```

# hostapd
## Install

```
sudo apt install hostapd
```

## Configuration
- `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`
  - set
    - ssid
    - channel
    - wpa_passphrase

```bash
# This is the name of the WiFi interface we configured above
interface=wlan0
# Use the nl80211 driver with the brcmfmac driver
driver=nl80211
# This is the name of the network
ssid=Pi3-AP
# Use the 2.4GHz band
hw_mode=g
# Use channel 6
channel=11
# Enable 802.11n
ieee80211n=1
# Enable WMM
wmm_enabled=1
# Enable 40MHz channels with 20ns guard interval
ht_capab=[HT40][SHORT-GI-20][DSSS_CCK-40]
# Accept all MAC addresses
macaddr_acl=0
# Use WPA authentication
auth_algs=1
# Require clients to know the network name
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
# Use WPA2
wpa=2
# Use a pre-shared key
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
# The network passphrase
wpa_passphrase=raspberry
# Use AES, instead of TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
```

## Test
Test it manually to make sure the configuration file is okay:

```bash
sudo hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```

- Scan and check for SSID `Pi3-AP`


## Run as Daemon
- Edit `hostapd` file under /etc/default/hostapd
  - Set config location `DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"`
- update `rc.d`

```bash
# set as service
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo systemctl start hostapd
```
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
# dnsmasq
```
sudo apt install dnsmasq
```
## config
- /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```bash
interface=wlan0      # Use interface wlan0  
listen-address=192.168.10.1 # Explicitly specify the address to listen on  
bind-interfaces      # Bind to the interface to make sure we aren't sending things elsewhere  
server=8.8.8.8       # Forward DNS requests to Google DNS  
domain-needed        # Don't forward short names  
bogus-priv           # Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.  
dhcp-range=192.168.10.50,192.168.10.150,12h
```

## Restart
```
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

## check for leases
```
cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
```
