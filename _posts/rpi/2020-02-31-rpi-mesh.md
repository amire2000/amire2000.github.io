With a mesh network there is no central access point or hub. The network is formed by the devices making direct connections with other devices in range (neighbours).
With a mesh network, at least one of the mesh devices needs to be a gateway to another network

```
sudo apt-get install -y batctl
```

- create `~/start-batman-adv.sh
` file 


```bash
#!/bin/bash
# batman-adv interface to use
sudo batctl if add wlan0
sudo ifconfig bat0 mtu 1468

# Tell batman-adv this is a gateway client
sudo batctl gw_mode client

# Activates batman-adv interfaces
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
sudo ifconfig bat0 up
```
